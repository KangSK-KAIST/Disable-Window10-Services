# Disable-Window10-Services

This batch file either completely disables the start of some of Windows10's services, or make it mandatory to take manual trigger.

To use it, run main.bat with administrator permission.

There are two modes in the program, (D)isabling mode and (M)anual mode.
Disabling a service might damage your system, so just make them manual if you want to be in the safe side.
Disable services at your own risk.

If there are some services you need, simply delete the line with the certain service in database.txt.
