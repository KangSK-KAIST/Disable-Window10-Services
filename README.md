# Disable-Window10-Services

This batch file either completely disables the start of some of Windows10's services, or make it mandatory to take manual trigger.

To use it, run main.bat with administrator permission.

Disabling a service might damage your system, so just make them manual if you want to be in the safe side.

If there are some services you need, simply delete the line with the certain service in database.txt.
